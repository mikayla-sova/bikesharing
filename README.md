## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to try and show investors data on bikeshare usage for New York City, so that they can decide if opening a bike-sharing program in Des Moines might be a worthwhile investment. This analysis consists of a story board in Tableau Public which contains 7 visualizations detailing user information for NYC Citi Bike.

## Summary

We can gather from the above visualizations that: 

-	Most of the bike checkout times are for an hour or less of use.
-	An overwhelming majority of the users are male.
-	During the weekdays, bikeshare hours are most popular during commuting hours. On the weekends, most users are centered around the daylight hours. 
-	Females and males tend to use bikeshare more commonly during the previously mentioned hours, however, males use bikeshare more.
-	Most of the usage is from subscribers, who use bikeshare programs most during the weekdays, especially Thursdays and Fridays. 
-	Subscribers make up majority of the user type.
-	The top starting locations show that most of the usage is concentrated on the island. 

To continue this analysis, I would also look at the ages of the users for the bikeshare program and compare this to the population in Des Moines. Additionally, I would also compare the amount of bike stations in NYC to the proposed amount for Des Moines, or at least map out where in Des Moines those stations would be located to try and get the highest amount of traffic. If the bikes are only being used in scenic areas, for example, it would be important to try and compare the amount of scenic areas in Des Moines as well to see how well a bike sharing program would do in Des Moines.
